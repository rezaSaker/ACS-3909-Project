# Campus Food Ordering System Concept App

## Background
This is a web-based food ordering system application that was initially developed as an in-course project for Advanced Intrnet Programming course that received a grade of 100% for the final product. The app provides all major functionalities of a food-ordering system including admin, employee, and customer features. Admins can create, update, and manage restaurants, menu items, and employee records, employees can view, accept/deny ordes and manage orders in real-time, and customers can place orders and track orderd as well as receieve real-time updates on their orders from the restaurants. The app is made in the context of a university campus for a more focused and practical development approach. Also, we focused more on the backend development as it started off as a backend project, but contains enough style element as of now for added practicality. The app does not provide any payment option as it was not in the scope of the project's goal.
